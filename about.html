   <h1>About us<br><span></h1>

      R&B Free-Range Chicken & Eggs is here and is now open to serve our tiny neighborhood in honor of our Papa Romy and Mama Bebing, whom we miss very dearly. Since they are not kept in cages, our hens are healthy and content. They always eat wholesome meals made up of grass, insects, feed, azolla, and worms. When herbal remedies are no longer effective, sick hens are treated with lemongrass, garlic, and medicine in their own hospital area to be kept apart from the others while they recover. Overall, Ma'am Sir, assured great quality.
